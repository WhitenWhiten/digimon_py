# Digimon_py

The porject is inspired by Pokemon(2022.11.11, Xiao Zhi won the world championship).  
And I thought about digimon, another virtual pet game, yet my childhood favorite anime.

I hoped to be a ***'chosen child'*** so so much. That's my childhood dream to have a v-mon, or guilmon.  
Especially guilmon, the digimon realized from a child's drawings, game cards. I want a such friend too.

This project is halfly translated from an old Java project:
[**eTamagotchi**](https://github.com/TheMaverickProgrammer/eTamagotchi)  

I just tried to compile it, suprisingly it worked, but only an egg on screen(later I read the source code, knowing that the condition is one day's wait)  
I love digimon so, and I always want to write my digimon pet system. And I think it's time.

Thus I translate parts of the Java to python, rewriting and modifying some parts, that's the project.
